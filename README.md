# JakeLanguage

This is a rough lexer for JakeLanguage.

It was originaly writen against Python 2.7.15rcl

This was never meant to be run anywhere else other than my personal laptop. However, the environment isn't too complicated.

**Make a virtual python environment** and install the pip packages listed in the requirments.txt

The *.vscode* directory in the repo. It should have some helpfull testing settings.
